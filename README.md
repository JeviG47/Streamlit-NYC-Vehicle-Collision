# Streamlit-NYC-Vehicle-Collision

This project aims to develop an interactive data analysis tool using Python, specifically utilizing the pandas library, to identify the top five most dangerous streets for New Yorkers to travel on. The tool allows users to select a specific type of affected person (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, motorists) and displays the top five dangerous streets for that group based on injury data.

**Features**:
Dropdown menu for selecting the type of affected person (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, motorists).
Filtering and sorting of data using pandas operations.
Display of the top five dangerous streets for the selected group.
Interactive web application interface.
Easy deployment to a remote server.
